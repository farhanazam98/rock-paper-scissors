# Rock Paper Scissors
This project is part of [the Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors)

In the first iteration of this project, I built a simple rock paper scissors game to get familiar with basic Javascript. In this iteration you play against the computer using the console. 

In the second iteration of this project, I built a barebones UI for this game to get familiar with DOM manipulation, event handling, and more. Here's a screenshot of what it looks like:
